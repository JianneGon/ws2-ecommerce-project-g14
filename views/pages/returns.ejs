    <!-- COMPLIANCE -->
    <h2>Compliance: Video Unboxing</h2>
    <p>
      As a best practice, we recommend our customers to video record their unboxing experience to ensure that the
      product has not been tampered with prior to opening. This helps protect both Commonwealth and the customer.
      This is also a requirement for insurance claims. Please note that this video has to be clear, not blurred,
      with adequate source of light, and not be shaky.
    </p>

    <p>
      Commonwealth is committed to providing our customers with high-quality products. If for any reason you are not
      satisfied with your purchase, we offer a flexible return and exchange policy to ensure your satisfaction.
      Please note that this does not apply to raffle items. All items sold from raffle are final.
    </p>

    <!-- RETURNS -->
    <h2>Returns</h2>
    <p>
      If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may send us an email. We will review your request and provide
      you with online store credits usable only for the online store. To be eligible for a return, customers should
      return items within <strong>7 days</strong> of receiving their order. The item must be in the same condition as
      when it was received and in its original packaging.
